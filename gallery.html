			<h1>Awesome Drink</h1>
			<hr>
			<h3>$3.99</h3>

			<p>Pepsi was created in 1893 by Caleb Bradham in his Drug Store in New Bern, North Carolina. The original name of this new drink was called "Brad's Drink" after Caleb Bradham himself. It was made with mix of sugar, water, caramel, lemon oil, nutmeg, and cola nuts. <br> On August 28th, 1898, Brad's Drink was renamed to Pepsi after pepsin enzyme. Bradham believed that his drink was a "healthy" cola that helped with digestion.</p>
